Hi, I have been told to contact you regarding an incident with the latest Inspire 1.
I have had the Inspire about 1 week
The first problem was 3 days ago
The aircraft was about 328 metres away when a message came up on my iPad which i was using with the Inspire, the message was “Remote Controller Signal Lost” and the screen was flashing red, i immediately pressed the RTH button, the craft came home, I tried flying in a different direction, the 2nd time I got 600 metres before i got the same message, again, i pressed RTH, got it back safely.
I contacted DJI and informed them of the problem, they said someone would get back to me.
The following day I contacted the supplying dealer to inform them of the problem, i was told to switch to dual output then try it again.
The same afternoon when a friend came i said i would try it again now I had made the adjustment, I sent the Inspire off again in a different direction taking the craft up to 433 ft to allow for any interference, i got 500 metres away and the same message came up again, again i pressed the RTH button and the craft turn around to start flying back home only this time it travelled about 250 metres, in the time it took to travel the 250 metres it lost 340 ft in altitude then it crashed. My friend said jump in the car and we will go and find it, we found some 10mins later up a tree, the tree was about 25/27ft tall. I rang another friend to ask him to recover it for me as he was a builder with ladders on his van, he came and got the thing back for me. I took it home after picking the Gimbal & camera up off the pavement and the battery off the waste land under the tree, the camera & gimbal was destroyed, the Inspire was unmarked virtually. I contacted DJI and i was asked to download the flight logs from the Inspire, they sent me a program to take the files off, i downloaded the files and uploaded them to DJI, they finally told me it would take 4 days to analyse the data.
DJI sent me an email today saying they had analysed the data and i enclose the email below.

Dear Sir, 

Thank you for contacting DJI support.
After analysis of your case, we find that the RC signal was connected all the time. But the live view did lost according to your description so that you clicked BTH. 
The root cause of "Auto-landing on a tree" is that triggered by operation of App. The aircraft received the instruction to land instead of BTH. 

As aside, why the live view lost in a distance? Could you please kindly fly in another place/location? Also please make sure your RC antennas are not crossed over and panel-point to your aircraft. 

Thank you for your understanding and patience. 


I contacted them on the 24 hour support again to tell them the R&D department was wrong, as I have said, i pressed the RTH button on the Transmitter but they are claiming I pressed the Auto Land. I didn’t know it had Auto land until today, i was told by the supplying dealer plus you can’t see the Auto land, infact you have to press a button in the App and then slide a bar like the iPad to enable that action. 

The problem is that the R&D are claiming that the craft received a signal land when the RTH button was pressed and the craft never lost RC connection, this is totally untrue as my friend will confirm, i have kept all the emails transcripts from speaking with the support line.
...
i feel totally let down by DJI, i think its disgusting the way they are treating me.
If someone would like to contact me i would be willing to answer any questions.
I have been flying RC Planes, Helis & Quads for a long time, i am flying instructor at my local RC club, I have asked DJi to supply the file extension so i can read the Data myself as i think the R&D department have made a mistake or they can’t read the data or the software has a bug in it.
